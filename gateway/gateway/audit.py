"""Audit logging — immutable record of every state-changing action.

Call sites use `record(...)`; this module owns the persistence path so individual
features (compute / benchmark / apps) don't have to import the model directly.
Best-effort: if the audit write fails the original action still succeeds — we
never want a logging glitch to break user-visible flows. Failures are logged
to the python logger so they're visible in `kubectl logs`.
